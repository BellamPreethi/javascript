3.write a brief about avaliable datatypes in javascript:
----------------------------------------------------------------
There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), 
composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function

3.boolean-->for true/false.
4.null----> for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
5.undefined-> for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
6.object--> for more complex data structures.
7.symbol--> for unique identifiers.
1.strings:
----------
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). 
Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters
example:
var a="hi";

2.number :
-------------
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers 
with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation
for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
eg:
var a=23;
var b=25;

3.boolean:
---------------
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. 
It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false)
eg:
var a=true;
var b=false;

4.undefined:
-------------
The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. 
If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined
eg:
var a;
var b = "Hello World!"
 
alert(a) // Output: undefined
alert(b) // Output: Hello World!

5.null:
----------
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value.
A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.
eg:
var a=null;
alert(a)

6.Object:
----------
The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. 
A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.
